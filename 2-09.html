         <b>Health</b>
          <P>Being healthy is the single, most important part of our existence — without good health, our lives can be cut short. That said, it’s important not to take good health for granted, and to instead feed our bodies the nutrients they deserve by eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity.

         <b>Family</b>
          <p>
            While you may sometimes argue and get annoyed with your family, they are your unit and the ones that you can turn to in times of happiness and sorrow. No matter what you go through with your family, they will always be there to guide and support you and to help you learn and grow as a person.The love from a family member is unconditional and should not be taken for granted. Some people go through life without truly appreciating just how important having their family’s support is and spend the majority their existence feeling unhappy. So, if you don’t usually show your family how much they mean to you, now is the time to start!

         <b>Education</b>
          <p>
            Having a good education will help you progress in life. This doesn’t necessarily mean that you must complete higher education to be successful. What it does mean is that you should continue to learn new things on a daily basis.The method of education is entirely up to you — you might want to watch an educational video, documentary or film, read a book, or watch the news. What is important is the knowledge you gain from your education and how you choose to apply it within your life.

         <b>passion</b>
          <p>
            Along with purpose comes passion; our desires, our dreams and our hopes in life. When you’re passionate about something, you’re going to work hard to achieve it. For example, Huda Kattan was a self-established makeup artist, but her passion for cosmetics pushed her to build a beauty empire that’s now worth over $600 million.That said, passion looks different for everyone; some people will be passionate about giving back to society, while others will have a passion for personal gain. Just ensure that your passion is for a good cause and that it brings joy not only to yourself but to others, too.

         <b>purpose</b>
          <p>
            Having a purpose is a fundamental component of living a fulfilling life. Without purpose, we won’t have the motivation to achieve great things or even do something simple such as getting out of bed in the morning. According to psychologist Steve Taylor, not having a purpose “makes us more vulnerable to boredom, anxiety and depression”.
